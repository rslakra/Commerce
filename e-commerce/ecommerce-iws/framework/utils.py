    HTTP Methods

    REST APIs listen for HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE to know which operations to perform on the web serviceâ€™s resources.
    The HTTP method tells the API which action to perform on the resource.

    401	Unauthorized	The client is not authorized to perform the requested action.
    404	Not Found	The requested resource was not found.
    415	Unsupported Media Type	The request data format is not supported by the server.
    422	Unprocessable Entity	The request data was properly formatted but contained invalid or missing data.
